:santa: :christmas_tree: Christmas is approaching so this is a great time to solve some really nice programming puzzles.

This repository contains my solutions for the problems posted each day on the Advent of Code 2017 website: http://adventofcode.com/2017.

Run `composer update` after cloning the project.

Run the php files from the *runnable* directory to solve the problems for each day.
