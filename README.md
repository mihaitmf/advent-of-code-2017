# Advent of Code 2017
http://adventofcode.com/2017

Christmas is approaching so it is a great time to do some really nice programming puzzles.

This repository contains my solutions for the problems posted each day in the Advent of Code 2017.

Run `composer update` after cloning the project.

Run the php files from the *runnable* directory to solve the problems for each day.
